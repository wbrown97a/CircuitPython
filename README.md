# CircuitPythons
I wired an LED and made it blink. I learned there are a lot more things you have to import into the code than on arduino. I also figured out that when it was not working it was the bread board not my code.
# Servo
I got a Servo to rotate between 0 and 180 degrees. I learned that naming your file as the same thing you are importing from your library does not work and causes it to import the code file and not the library file.
